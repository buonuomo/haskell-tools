# haskell-tools
A collection of command line utilities written in Haskell for various tasks that I need to do

This is an ongoing project, and I will be adding more utilities as I make them

Finally, a disclaimer: most of these tools are far easier and more elegantly
implemented in a bash script (and many of them are originally based off of bash
scripts that I wrote), but I think it's good fun and practice to solve various problems in
haskell, so I wrote these anyway.
